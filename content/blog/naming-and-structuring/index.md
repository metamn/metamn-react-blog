## Hard problem

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

This [cliche](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19836/has-phil-karlton-ever-said-there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science) is so true it doesn't even need quotes.

Naming is hard because it's subjective. However, with time, consensus is possible. After all we've managed to name colors.

## Why naming is important?

Good naming conventions reduce cognitive load and enable interoperability.

### Cognitive load

First, they make easy to _learn_ the system. Then to _use_ the system.

When a system is able to become second nature for its users their attention will spend on improving it, build with it.

Rather than on finding the way&mdash;again and again&mdash;how to do it.

Naming and structuring&mdash;breaks or makes a system.

### Interoperability.

Once a great naming convention pops up&mdash;it's adapted en masse. This leads to the `learn once, use everywhere` phenomena.

## What to name?

In design systems: the folder structure, the component names and the component props.

Folders, components and props form a design system's API.

## The current state

The idea of a [Minimal API Surface Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8) is on the web development / design systems agenda. With results pouring in.

- [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) shows a way to name and structure tokens.
- [CSS Layout](https://csslayout.io/) and [UI Guideline](https://www.uiguideline.com/components) offer decent hints for naming and structuring components.
- [Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/blog/defining-component-apis-in-react/) shares his experinces in naming props.
- [The Deno Style Guide](https://deno.land/manual@v1.6.3/contributing/style_guide) tells us about reducing the number of props.

The list is not complete. It will never be. But it's good enough to take another humble attempt on naming and structuring a design system.
