## Hard problem

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

This [cliche](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19836/has-phil-karlton-ever-said-there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science) is so true it doesn't even need quotes.

Computer science is exact science. Except naming, where the subjective slips in.

## Naming conventions

Good naming conventions reduce cognitive load.

First, they make easy to **learn** the system. Then to **use** the system.

When a system is able to become second nature for its users their attention will spend on improving it, build with it. Rather than on finding the way&mdash;again and again&mdash;how to do it.

Naming and structuring&mdash;breaks or makes a system.

## In design systems

Design systems shine when their folder structure&mdash;and&mdash;their component and prop names shine.

They together form the **API** of a design system.

The idea of a [Minimal API Surface Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8) is on the web development agenda. With results pooring in.

- [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) shows a way to name and structure tokens.
- [CSS Layout](https://csslayout.io/) and [UI Guideline](https://www.uiguideline.com/components) offer decent hints for naming and structuring components.
- [Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/blog/defining-component-apis-in-react/) tells us about naming props.
- [The Deno Style Guide](https://deno.land/manual@v1.6.3/contributing/style_guide) tells us about reducing the number of props.

The list is not complete. Will never be. It's good enough to take another humble take on naming and structuring a design system.
