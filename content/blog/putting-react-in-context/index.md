title: 'Putting React in context'

A deep dive into the language and the ecosystem around.

<!--more-->

---

After deploying my first commercial React app I've started to learn more about the nuts and bolts of the language, the new way of thinking it employs, and how the ecosystem helps to make it all happen.

The process is ongoing and is far from being finished. The journey is pure joy. Learning new paradigms, talking with core members, contributing to libraries, putting it all together, deep dive into details, write prototypes and live documentation.

Just to get a glimpse about how vast the React context is &mdash; please allow me to present the main concepts.

~~Stay tuned, details are on the way.~~

## Updates

This article will be continuously updated to serve as a central hub for the concepts presented above.

There is an ongoing experience on [Github](https://github.com/metamn/react-best-practices) distilled into a [documentation site](http://metamn.io/react-best-practices/?path=/docs/home--page).

When considerable results are found a new article is written and linked below.
