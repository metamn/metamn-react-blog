GraphQL comes from the same family as React.

## A short history

GraphQL was developed by Facebook at the same time when React was created. Perhaps they are perfect running mates.

As React defined a new era in web frameworks so GraphQL did it with APIs. The list of features on [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/) clearly points to a paradigm shift:

- Ask for what you need, get exactly that
- Get many resources in a single request
- Describe whatâ€™s possible with a type system
- Evolve your API without versions

Since React is [built on functional reactive programming](http://metamn.io/react/react-is-functional-and-reactive/) one might wonder if this is also true for GraphQL.
