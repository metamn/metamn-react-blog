[Cory House](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1185222395210153984?s=20) nails it.

Even if there is [no official style guide](http://metamn.io/react/there-is-no-official-style-guide-for-react/) to write React code &mdash; there are official [guidelines](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) and [rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) to follow, and a common sense emerging from [the leaders](Identify the right leaders).

In [Lessons learned from 5 years in React](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsid5bnphznbvjv/Lessons%20learned%20from%205%20years%20in%20React.docx?dl=0) Cory House collects his wisdom into one single document. I found it deeply resonating with my practice &mdash; and the common sense.

(With his hopefully mutual permission) I'm replicating the document as checkboxes to see those points I've met, and the ones where I might catch up.

You can do the same exercise too by reusing the list from the source code of this article.
