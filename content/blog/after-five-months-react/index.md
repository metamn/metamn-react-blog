We couldn't have better news. Lean code. Official stack. Strong leader.

**This is the second post in a series of three.**

I have React, [Gatsby](/after-five-months-gatsby) and [Storybook](/after-five-months-storybook) projects to update and work on them again.

A hiatus can introduce pain in restarting work on old projects. Frameworks change quickly. Now let's see how the React ecosystem handles this.

### React

Two major things happened to React in the last months: Hooks, and the Facebook.com 2019 complete redesign.

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) removed boilerplate and bloat from React code and enabled better re-use of business logic.

A React app now looks _less_ like a React app and more like any other app. We've been waiting for this!

[The Facebook.com 2019 complete rewrite and redesign](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) means the inventor of React put its invention to a serious work &mdash; eats its own dogfood.

Facebook uses for its latest redesign the `React` + `GraphQL` + `Relay` + `Suspense` stack making it quasi the _official_ stack.

One can still choose another way &mdash; but why? &mdash; losing the support of the framework leader.

Frameworks can be a trap when you reinvent the wheel. Frameworks works best if you follow the way of the creators. I've learn this (painfully) with Ruby on Rails, and, successfully with WordPress.

To follow the leader I'll switch to the [Facebook stack](https://opensource.facebook.com/): `React` + `Flow` + `Create React App` + `GraphQL` + `Relay` + `Jest`.

**Verdict**

We couldn't have better news.

1. Writing code became simplified
2. We have an official guideline to navigate between the huge React ecosystem
3. We have a strong leader: [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)
