A hiatus can introduce pain in restarting work on old projects. Frameworks change quickly. Now let's see how the React ecosystem handles this.

One attraction of oldish frameworks is that hey are stable. I can fire up a decade old WordPress project with no problem.

With new frameworks a (five month) hiatus takes a toll. I have [React](/after-five-months-react), Gatsby and [Storybook](/after-five-months-storybook) projects to update and work on them again.
