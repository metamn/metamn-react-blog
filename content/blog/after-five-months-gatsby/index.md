Theming and live preview: the most important features of a classic CMS now available also in Gatsby.

**This is the third post in a series of three.**

A hiatus can introduce pain in restarting work on old projects. Frameworks change quickly. Now let's see how the React ecosystem handles this.

I have [React](/after-five-months-react), Gatsby and [Storybook](/after-five-months-storybook) projects to update and work on them again.

### Gatsby

Gatsby made two great features in the last period: theming and live previews.

With [Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-11-gatsby-themes-roadmap/) one can assembly Gatsby sites from pre-existing parts. Import a core blog engine, import the marketing website module, or a landing page module &mdash; and voila!

I guess this feature will help people to considerably speed up the development process by re-using code written for earlier projects. Great news, Gatsby!

With [Live preview](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-22-introducing-gatsby-preview-beta/) editors can preview their work as they got used to with classic CMSs like WordPress: write a post and preview before publish.

Before Live preview the editor had to wait the site to be compiled first, then a preview become available. In sites with many pages (thousands?) this could take minutes.

**Verdict**

Gatsby is gradually adding what was best in old CMSs still keeping it's edge &mdash; incorporating what's best on the front-end.

For more and more people &mdash; content creators, static site developers &mdash; it will be a fully viable alternative replacing ... eh WordPress.
