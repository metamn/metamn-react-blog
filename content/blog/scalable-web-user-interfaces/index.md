A short study.

## Introduction

Scalability in software systems is a huge topic.

It deals with the product, the production process, with the technology used in the product and in producing the product.

The product should be fast, correct and usable. The process should be stable, extensible, and maintainable &mdash; requiring as little cognitive load as possible.

The parts of tech stack should be carefully picked during trials and experimentations. Then merged into a system with herculean work.

Narrowing down scalability to web user interfaces reduces the complexity of the problem.
Hopefuly to a level one can comprehend, can study, and present the findings in a compact way.

## Scalability in _uniform_ web user interfaces

Web design and development started thirty years ago. Since then it went through three major iterations.

The last iteration &mdash; web components &mdash; is pretty recent, widespread and production ready. Among other advantages, web components help creating uniform web interfaces, aka. design systems.

This study will focus on scalable design systems. General web user interface scalability, or scalability of component libraries is left for another occasion.
