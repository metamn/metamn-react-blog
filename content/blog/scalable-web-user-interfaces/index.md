A short study.

## Introduction

Scalability in software systems is a huge topic.

It deals with the product, the production process, with the technology used in the product and in producing the product.

The product should be fast, correct and usable. The process should be stable, extensible, and maintainable &mdash; requiring as little cognitive load as possible.

The parts of tech stack should be carefully picked during trials and experimentations. Then merged into a system with herculean work.

Narrowing down scalability to web user interfaces reduces the complexity of the problem.
Hopefuly to a level one can comprehend, can study, and present the findings in a compact way.

## Scalability in web user interfaces

This special context renders a few general scalability issues pointless.

For example, on product speed
