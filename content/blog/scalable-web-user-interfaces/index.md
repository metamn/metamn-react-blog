## Introduction

Scalability in software systems is a complex topic.

It deals with the product, the production process, and with the technology used in the product and in producing the product.

The product should be fast, correct and usable. The process should be stable, extensible, and maintainable &mdash; requiring as little cognitive load as possible.

The parts of the tech stack should be carefully picked during trials and experimentations. Then merged into a system with herculean work.

Complexity rises together with product size.

Products might have complex features and building blocks &mdash; some of them acting as standalone products. That makes the `product <-> scalability` matrix multi-dimensional.

Narrowing down scalability to web user interfaces reduces the complexity of the problem.
Hopefully to a level one can comprehend, can study, and present the findings in a compact way.

## Scalability in _consistent_ web user interfaces

Web design and development started thirty years ago. Since then it went through three major iterations.

The last iteration &mdash; the component model &mdash; is young, widespread and production ready. Among other advantages, [it helps creating uniform, consistent web interfaces](), aka. design systems.

This study will focus on scalable design systems.

General web user interface scalability, covering component libraries and template-based UI frameworks is out of scope. They would drive this study complex and incomprehensible.

Even alone, scalable design systems act as a complex topic. To tackle: requires a progressive approach. Mapping the problem domain, picking the critical parts to solve first, then iterating.
