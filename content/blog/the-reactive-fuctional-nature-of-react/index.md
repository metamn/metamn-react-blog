## The context

Both paradigms solve the same problem — to build modular, interactive applications — in different ways.

The old way implemented modularity through tight-coupling and interaction synchronously. The new way implements modularity with loose-coupling and interaction asynchronously.

Modularity and interaction abstracted to composition and coupling can further elucidate the picture. Composition is about how the components of the system can add up to form a whole, while coupling is about how they communicate with each other.

[Functional reactive programming](https://blog.danlew.net/2017/07/27/an-introduction-to-functional-reactive-programming/) deals with composition the functional programming way and with coupling the reactive programming way.
