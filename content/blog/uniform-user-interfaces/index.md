A short study.

## The problem

Uniform user interfaces eliminate visual and logical glitches providing a seamless experience.

An user interface, when it is uniform it _feels_ complete. Not only has no visible errors but the experience it provides resembles enjoying an artwork.

Uniform UIs talk about the intent and the mastery of its creators. They persuade. They deliver an important message.

## The current landscape

Few user interfaces are uniform today.

If we take newspapers &mdash; the business segment living off by how successfuly they present content &mdash; the experience they provide is not seamless.

Please open Financial Times, Bloomberg, The Spectator, South China Morning Post, The Washington Post, Le Monde Diplomatique &mdash; you name it &mdash; in a desktop browser, with a regular 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution.

Unless zoomed to 150-170% the experience is poor. Once the site design is adjusted manually by the user &mdash; it becomes infinitely enjoyable.

A good question is why these sites don't come in full screen / at maximum usability by deafult.

Is it technically impossible? Don't they have the resources? The necessary will perhaps?

## The technical aspect

I can answer the first question, for sure. Yes, it is possible to make perfect websites.

The journey is long, the technologies are young. The process takes discipline and grit.

The theory is simple. It takes a couple of minutes and a few concepts to master &mdash; then ready.

## User interfaces

User interfaces display information enhanced with structure, presentation style and behavior.

Structure and presentation is familiar from graphic and print design. It defines layout and style.

Behavior is specific to interactive environments. This dynamic context requires the user interface to handle change &mdash; to behave on change.

## Web user interfaces

Web user interfaces rely on a specific technology &mdash; the browser &mdash; to display information.

The browser, on its own, uses diverse technologies to deal with structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

These technologies are standalone yet result in web sites and apps when combined.

## Binding

The method of binding HTML, CSS and JavaScript together is important.

Every method defines an era in web design and development.

**Classless** (No) binding, from the beginning, makes no bounds between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It leaves content as is, with little manual styling.

**Class-based** binding, a next iteration, connects the parts via HTML attributes (class names, class ids, data attributes). This paradigm is programmable and successful. Google, Facebook, Twitter and everything else was built on it.

**Props**, the web component model, the third iteration, integrates natively all parts into a single standalone component. And composes up components via props.

Web components represent a shift of a similar magnitude like the previous shift from classless to class-based binding.

Components make uniform user interfaces possible more than ever.

## API

The acronym stands for Application Programming Interface.

All programmable systems expose an API &mdash; a general software artifact with common theory behind. APIs are important. They scale.

Class and prop-based user interfaces are programmable. The expose an API and they scale.

It turns out with scale some APIs / UIs loose their uniformity. Namely, open APIs tend to produce non-uniform UIs, closed APIs guarantee uniform UIs.

Open APIs let developers bind freely, arbitrarily structure, presentation and behavior. Close APIs impose constraints over the binding assuring integrity an uniformity.

As bindings, web UI APIs are important. They define common concepts like CSS frameworks, component libraries, design systems.
