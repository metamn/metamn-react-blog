A short study.

## The problem

Uniform user interfaces eliminate visual and logical glitches providing a seamless experience.

An user interface, when it is uniform it **feels** complete. Not only has no visible errors but the experience it provides resembles enjoying an artwork.

Uniform UIs talk about the intent and the mastery of its creators. They persuade. They deliver an important message.

## The current landscape

Few user interfaces are uniform today.

If we take newspapers &mdash; the business segment living off by how successfuly they present content &mdash; the experience they provide is not seamless.

Please open Financial Times, Bloomberg, The Spectator, South China Morning Post, The Washington Post, Le Monde Diplomatique &mdash; you name it &mdash; in a desktop browser, with a regular 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution.

Unless zoomed to 150-170% the experience is poor. Once the site design is adjusted manually by the user &mdash; it becomes infinitely enjoyable.

A good question is why these sites don't come in full screen / at maximum usability by deafult.

Is it technically impossible? Don't they have the resources? The necessary will perhaps?

## The technical aspect

I can answer the first question, for sure. Yes, it is possible to make perfect websites.

The journey is long, the technologies are young. The process takes discipline and grit.

The next sections will present user interfaces, web technologies to display user interfaces, how they work together to create non-uniform or uniform user interfaces.
