A humble take.

## Hard problem

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

This [cliche](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19836/has-phil-karlton-ever-said-there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science) is so true it doesn't even need quotes.

Computer science is exact science. Except naming, where the subjective slips in.

## Cognitive load

Good naming conventions reduce cognitive load.

First, they make easy to _learn_ the system. Then to _use_ the system.

When a system becomes second nature for its users their attention will spend on improving it, build with it.

Not on finding its parts, or, in worst case, locate different parts required to perform a single task.

Naming and structuring breaks or makes.

## In design systems

Design systems shine when the folder structure&mdash;and&mdash;the component and prop names shine.

They together form the API of the system.
