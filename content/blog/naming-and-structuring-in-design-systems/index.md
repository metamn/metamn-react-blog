A humble take.

## Hard problem

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

This [cliche](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/19836/has-phil-karlton-ever-said-there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science) is so true it doesn't even need quotes.

Computer science is exact science. Except naming, where the subjective slips in.

## Cognitive load

Good naming conventions reduce cognitive load.

First, they make easy to **learn** the system. Then to **use** the system.

When a system becomes second nature for its users their attention will spend on improving it, build with it.

Not on finding its parts, or, in worst case, locate different parts required to perform a single task.

Naming and structuring breaks or makes.

## In design systems

Design systems shine when the folder structure&mdash;and&mdash;the component and prop names shine.

They together form the **API** of a design system.

No wonder the idea of a [Minimal API Surface Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8) is on the agenda in web development. With success. To achieve such peaks we've got help.

- [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) shows a folder structure for tokens.
- [CSS Layout](https://csslayout.io/) and [UI Guideline](https://www.uiguideline.com/components) offer decent hints for naming and structuring components.
- [Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/blog/defining-component-apis-in-react/) of the JXNBLK fame tells us about naming props.
- [The Deno Style Guide](https://deno.land/manual@v1.6.3/contributing/style_guide) tells us about reducing the number of props.

Keep calm and let's dive in. Following common sense and subjective mindset.

No pressure. The outcome, for sure, will be another humble take. But at least we'll learn the current practices.
