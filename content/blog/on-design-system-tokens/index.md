## Tokens

Tokens are the base layer of design systems and component libraries.

This is where typography, color, scaling, spacing settings goes together with other primitives like background patterns, borders and other decorations.

## Fragmentation

Everybody rolls their own design system and component library without a common theory behind.

This led to lack of interoperability between them at basic, token level.

While tokens define the same settings, the different naming conventions make them unique.

Tokens from a design system are not compatible with tokens from another design system.

## Theme Specification

[Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/), an open source organization and initiative, is singular in the attempt to standardize tokens and enable interoperable UI components.

Github, Artsy, Gatsby and others embrace this theory and build their design systems upon.

While the naming conventions convince the technology behind isn't up-to-date.
