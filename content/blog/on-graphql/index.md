## Overview

GraphQL is a functional, reactive approach to work with APIs. Developed by Facebook it's a perfect running mate for React.

[According to its creator](https://nordicapis.com/is-graphql-moving-toward-ubiquity/) it is expected to become ubiquitos in 2020-2021.

Until then one can tinker well with on client side using Apollo Client and get a fully managed backend service &mdash; [one of its kind at the moment](https://graphql.org/code/#services) &mdash; from Amazon through AppSync.

## Functional and reactive

[GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/) presents a nice list of features &mdash; some devs might find it irresistible. Apollo goes further and makes a great [comparision](https://blog.apollographql.com/graphql-vs-rest-5d425123e34b) to REST.

The architectural advantages look obvious. However, there is more. By employing decoupling and composition GraphQL follows the reactive functional paradigm of React and fits in the [landscape](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) defined by Facebook: data-driven applications.
