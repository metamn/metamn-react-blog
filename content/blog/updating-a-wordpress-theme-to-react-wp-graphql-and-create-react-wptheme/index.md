Headless as simple as possible.

What if you have to update an old WordPress theme to React? And your only option is to upload a new theme in the WordPress dashboard?

No static site generation with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and no server side rendering with [Next](https://nextjs.org/).

What left is [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to build a Single Page Application. More exactly [create-react-wptheme](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme) which adapts `create-react-app` to WordPress.

The `create-react-wptheme` experience is very smooth. So smooth there is nothing to learn about. You can use the same commands to develop and deploy like when you create a regular React app. Big kudos to [@devloco](https://github.com/devloco), the unknown code artist.
